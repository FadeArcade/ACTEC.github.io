                        <h3>CompTIA</h3>
                     <p>CompTIA, the world’s leading tech association, is a thought leader and an action leader. 
                        From our new IT professional association to our leading certification programs, from our 
                        original research to our member communities and councils, our unparalleled programs set industry standards, 
                        foster skills development and generate knowledge and insight every day. With our members, we’re building the 
                        foundation for technology’s future.</p>
                        
                             <h3>Why Get Certified?</h3><br>
                             <p>Great, lucrative and family-sustaining IT jobs are out there, but the vast majority of candidates are 
                                not yet qualified. CompTIA certifications help to train and identify qualified, knowledgeable employees 
                                and match them with employers who have jobs to fill. And, employers know CompTIA. When you show up for a 
                                job interview with CompTIA credentials CERTIFICATIONS: under your belt, that employer knows that you not only have
                                 the IT skills to do the job, but you also have a commitment to your career to continue learning. <br> <br>

                                If you’re interested in becoming certified, we’ll take you through the process from beginning to certification.
                                 We’ll give you options on how you can study for the exam and help you narrow down which training centers and study materials 
                                 provide the best training resources. We will also help you purchase exam vouchers and find the training site nearest to you.</p>

                       <p>AAMC Training provides certificate and noncertificate training courses across a number of industries to give jobseekers 
                        relevant skills that can match the demands of today’s businesses. We are endorsed by the Technical Education and Skills Development 
                        Authority (TESDA) and have accredited over 20 courses that are most relevant for the Philippine market.<br><br>

                        Judging by how expensive college education is these days, you should get what you pay for — or a job at the least. Meanwhile, 
                        employers are complaining that there are just not enough people out there with the skills they need.<br><br>
                        
                        Australasian Academy of Mentoring and Coaching (AAMC) Training, Inc. was founded to help bridge that gap between the skills companies 
                        want and the ones workers actually have.
